## Dev Update 1
First milestone for this project is on 17th March. Goal of this milestone was to create Character controllers, Obstacles, Menu and Split Screen.

### Menu
Menu UI was created at the start of application. It has 3 options (Play, Options, Quit). Also if the user presses ESC-key, then the pause menu will 
pop-out with 3 options(Resume, Menu, Quit).
For creating Menu UI was used Canvas and Buttons game objects. Buttons have also zoom-in animation, when they are selected.
