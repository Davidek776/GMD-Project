# Game Development Blog post #2 - Lost Together

## Dev Update 2
Second milestone for this project is on 14th April. Goal of this milestone was to create Enviroment, Triggers, Collaboration logic between characters, Animations and Character Sprites.

### Enviroment
For the game enviroment was used assset from Unity Asset Store that is accesible here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/2d-hand-painted-platformer-environment-227159. This asset was chosen, because it's aestetics and possibilities match our expectations that were described in Design Document. Asset consists of multiple layers and has parralax effect. Thanks to the perspective camera it gives the player sense of depth, because it is showing each layer on different position on Z-axis.
