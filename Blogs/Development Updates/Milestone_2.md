# Game Development Blog post #2 - Lost Together

## Dev Update 2
The second milestone for this project is on 14th April. The goal of this milestone was to create an Environment, Triggers, Collaboration logic between characters, Animations and Character Sprites.

### Environment
For the game environment was used asset from Unity Asset Store which is accessible here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/2d-hand-painted-platformer-environment-227159. This asset was chosen, because its aesthetics and possibilities match our expectations that were described in Design Document. The asset consists of multiple layers and has a parallax effect. Thanks to the perspective camera it gives the player a sense of depth because it shows each layer on different positions on Z-axis. Moreover, the asset has leaves particle system that adds a more dynamic pattern to the game.
